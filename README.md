## NAVBAR & LANDING SECTION

Landing page is the first impression of your portfolio. It's meant to be simple but the at the same time be attractive & elegant.
Following things will help you in achieving your best landing page:

👉 Navigation Bar :
   + Keep this simple with 3-4 buttons only. (About, Projects, Skills, Contact)
   + Add burger menu for small screen sizes with help of Bootstrap.
   + Small things like height of navbar matter a lot for design. So keep in mind to do it correct.
   + For more features, try to make it stick at the top and add interactive buttons (See scrollspy in bootstrap)

👉 Homepage:
   + Keep homepage simple with just your name, photo & introduction.
   + Add at most 3 buttons for resume download, contact section and skill/projects.
   + Buttons must lie under your basic description/intro to make the most impact.
   + For photo you can use your own face or some may prefer using a gif/png that suits your personality.
   + for more features you can add background effects, such as particles, shapes or icons according to your tech stack.

   + Make font and numbers bigger and bold when it comes to facts, figures and important details
